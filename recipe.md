Recipe for vanilla cake:

1. Butter and flour two 9″ cake pans and preheat oven to 350˚F.
2. Whisk together dry ingredients.
3. With an electric mixer, beat Butter and Sugar 5 minutes.
4. Beat in eggs 1 at a time then beat in vanilla.
5. Add flour mixture in thirds alternating with buttermilk and mixing between each addition.
6. Divide between 2 cake pans and bake at 350˚F for 28-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in pans 10 minutes then transfer cakes (we use this cake release tool) to a wire rack and cool completely before frosting.
